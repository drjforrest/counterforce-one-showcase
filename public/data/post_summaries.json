    "notes": "U=U concept is scientifically accurate (CDC/WHO/NIH endorsed). However, post contains a significant typo: uses > (greater than) instead of < (less than) for viral load thresholds. Should read <200 and <40, not >200 and >40. This error could confuse readers about what undetectable means. Community reinforces accurate science and adds important context about trust, adherence, and other STIs. Great demo of: community correcting/contextualizing imperfect information."

    "notes": "Contains real science with legitimate PubMed citations (gut damage, lymphatic fibrosis). However, title/framing is alarmist and suggests treatment doesn't work well - misleading. Overstates universality of symptoms and permanent damage. Valid lived experience but missing context that MOST people on ART live relatively normal lives. Community shows mixed response - some validate experience, some question if AI-generated. Great demo of: subtle misinformation detection, community debate."

    "community_response": "educational",
    "notes": "Discusses risk perception and PrEP vs condoms. Post has slightly preachy/morally superior tone but raises valid concerns. Reveals potential knowledge gap in community (PrEP only prevents HIV, not other STIs). Community response is highly educational: reminds about drug-resistant gonorrhea, shares STI experiences, supports bodily autonomy. Balanced perspectives (some prefer condoms, some raw with PrEP). Great demo of: community health education in action, risk decision-making discussions."
