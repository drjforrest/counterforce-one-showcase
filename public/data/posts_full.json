    "title": "HIV is life altering whether your on treatment or not (What they don’t tell you)",
    "selftext": "There’s a popular mantra floating around: *\"Just take your pill once a day and everything will be fine.\"* And while it's true that antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV into a manageable condition for many, the truth is much more nuanced — and for some of us, far more complicated.\n\nThis post is meant to be informative, not for fear mongering. I just hate how dismissed this is, despite everything that comes with the condition (speaking first hand).\n\nSources:\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5467125/\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8005487/\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8238090/\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7331798/\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5808407/\n\nHere’s what rarely gets discussed:\n\n# 1. Your Gut Takes a Hit — Early and Possibly Permanently\n\nHIV causes massive **damage to the gut lining** within days of infection. Over 50% of the body’s immune cells are in the gut, and HIV decimates this population early. Even with treatment, the **mucosal barrier may never fully heal**, leaving some people with long-term issues like:\n\n* Chronic diarrhea\n* Food intolerances\n* Microbial imbalances (dysbiosis)\n* Low-grade inflammation\n* Leaky gut, which may fuel systemic immune activation\n\n# 2. Lymphatic System Damage Is Real\n\nHIV infects lymph nodes early on, leading to **fibrosis** (scar-like stiffening) that traps immune cells — including CD4 T-cells — and prevents them from circulating effectively. This can contribute to:\n\n* Persistent low CD4 counts, even with viral suppression\n* Night sweats\n* Poor immune surveillance\n* Swelling or tenderness in lymph-rich areas\n\nThe damage is often **irreversible**, especially in those diagnosed late or after years without treatment.\n\n# 3. Some Viruses Don’t Stay Quiet\n\nPeople living with HIV are more vulnerable to **latent viruses** like:\n\n* **Cytomegalovirus (CMV)**\n* **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)**\n* **HHV-8 (associated with Kaposi’s Sarcoma)**\n* **Herpesviruses in general**\n\nThese viruses can reactivate even on ART, especially when the immune system is weakened or recovering. This can lead to fatigue, pain, inflammation, and even organ involvement.\n\n# 4. You Can Be Virally Undetectable and Still Feel Unwell\n\nNot everyone feels “normal” on ART. Some live with:\n\n* Chronic fatigue\n* Muscle or joint pain\n* Brain fog or cognitive changes\n* Mood shifts or depression\n* Sleep disturbances\n\nThis doesn’t mean ART isn’t working. It means the body has been through **a lot**, and **not all damage is reversible**, even if the virus is “controlled.”\n\n# 5. The Stigma + Medical Gaslighting Compound the Damage\n\nSome providers dismiss lingering symptoms if your viral load is undetectable. Some online communities shame people who say they don’t\n\n feel great, accusing them of fearmongering or exaggeration. But the reality is:\n\n* HIV is **medically and socially** complex.\n* “Undetectable” doesn’t always mean “unaffected.”\n* Healing isn’t one-size-fits-all.\n\n# TLDR:\n\nYes — taking your meds **daily** is critical and lifesaving. But it’s **not a magic eraser** for all the damage HIV causes, especially when diagnosed late or if co-infections are involved.\n\nInstead of brushing off long-term symptoms, we need better care, deeper understanding of post-HIV recovery, and a more honest conversation about what it really means to live with this virus — treated or not.\n\nYou're not “doing it wrong” if you’re still struggling. You’re just human, dealing with a very real, very complicated condition that **deserves more than a slogan**.\n---\n---\n\nEdit: I’m honestly shocked by all of the responses… deflections and outright lack of empathy.\n\nFor anyone doubting, I wrote this post because I am personally going through these things.. I’m not speaking on anyone else’s experience or basing this off of made up scenarios. Wow, this really opened my eyes. \n\nI don't think this will happen to everyone but it happened to ME. For those who empathize with my health issues, I appreciate you.",

That *might not last forever* - we have staggering levels of national debt, hugely increasing healthcare, care, pension and interest costs. Will that mean that prescriptions cease to be almost free one day? I don’t know. Will the NHS always be free? Also don’t know. Maybe, maybe not. \n\nBut given how drug companies have raised prices by literally thousands of percent (lookup the pricing of epi pens to see what I mean) - I wouldn’t want to put myself in a position where I either buy the product of a pharmaceutical company, or I die. If they jacked the price up to say £500 a month, you *would* pay it somehow. You’d pretty much *have to*. \n\nThe improvements in healthcare for HIV in the last few decades has been *miraculous* - and that truly is fantastic.

I have mine right next to my bed so it's the first thing I do every morning . This helps me to remember. It is important you take these meds so you don't get sick. If you take your meds consistently you'll become undetectable and it will be impossible for you spread the virus to others. Pretty sure PEP is covered by most insurances. If you're on your parents insurance they'll be able to see what's being billed so they'll likely know. It seems like you're concerned about keeping this from them so I'd ask your doctor or look around to see if there are alternatives/free programs. \n\nI'm also sorry that you feel so lonely. It's tough, and I think many of us experience that, especially at that age. It sounds like because of that you've made some risky decisions (again, something we've all done) but you need to be more responsible now. You'll need to disclose your status to your future partners. You'll be tempted to keep it yourself because some people won't want to sleep with you once they know. However it's wrong to keep this from them, they deserve to be able to make informed decisions. Also depending on where you live sleeping with someone without disclosing your status might be illegal. \n\nYou should also try to let your past hookups know if possible so they can get tested too so they can get tested. This step is pretty terrible NGL. But it's important to mitigate damage. \n\nOther than disclosure having HIV is NOT THAT BAD if you stay on your meds. You're going to be fine. You're going to be A-OK kid. You don't need daily shots like you would with diabetes. You don't need to change your diet. You don't need surgery\n There's no chronic pain. You'll be great.",

My best friend left work early to meet me at hospital and when he got there we had the briefest little cry before he killed off any shame or sadness or desire to cry for longer by quipping ‘omg I’ll have to buy a blond wig so I can dress as Princess Di and have pictures taken with you’ to which we both howled with laughter and in an instant it ceased to be a big deal. The doctor assured me I’d be alright and basically broke it all down to a simple ‘don’t worry the only change you’ll notice is that instead of taking a blue pill every day it’ll probably be a red one’ and even said I’d probably now live longer than if I didn’t get the diagnosis, pointing out that from that moment on if at any point in life I develop some other life threatening disease etc, it’ll likely be picked up way sooner than if I remained negative. \nBest friend then insisted he come back to my parents house (where I was living at the time) because he knew I would chicken out of telling them, and his being there made it so easy to sit and tell my mum that I had received this diagnosis, repeating his joke and once again ending it as an issue. \n\nSo roughly 10 hours from phone call asking me to pop back to the hospital to sitting mum down and telling her. Bestie and I then drove to Brighton to see a drag show because we adopted a ‘live in the moment’ approach.\n\nI know it is overwhelming. But you will be fine. And the people that matter; whether you’ve met them yet or not, will never look at you differently for this. \n\nWishing you love, joy, and peace x",

        "body": "Your life is not over!\n\nI was diagnosed a bit over 20 years ago. In that time I have seen newer and better medications come out from a pill each day to a shot every six months or so. I have seen the rise of prep and doxypep. Who knows what improvements the future will bring?\n\nIn a lot of ways having HIV is a lot better than having diabetes. For one thing it's easily treatable and your overall quality of life is largely better as the consistent doctor appointments and check ups mean that anything that happens to you is caught really quickly and addressed before it becomes an issue. In many ways I am significantly healthier right now than my hiv negative friends.\n\nYou do not have to tell your parents your status. Mine don't know and honestly it's none of their business. Depending on where you live your clinic or hiv resources can help you with the medication there. But you should probably let your core group of trusted friends know. You still need a community to help you process and it is much healthier than dealing with it alone.\n\nHaving hiv does not exclude you from finding love. In this day and age a lot of people have more understanding of what undetectable means and because prep is so readily available it does not phase them.\n\nPlease use the counseling resources available to you (group or solo) and give yourself the grace to grow and improve from this experience. Remember this doesn't define who you are. Only you get to do that.",

        "body": "It only takes one encounter with someone who is positive and not being treated to spread this disease, so there is no point in beating yourself up for the extra risks you took due to your state of mind.  You also admit even in your better times, you still didn't always practice safer sex, so it could have happened at any time.  The next step is what you are going to do about it. There are ways to stay healthy even when you are hiv positive, and live a pretty good life. Make sure you do not spread this on to others, use condoms.  The obvious answer is PrEP  or perhaps better for someone like yourself doxyPrEP to reduce the risk of other transmissible conditions. You now live in a time that an hiv diagnoses doesn't need to be either the end of your sex life, or your life, so be happy you live in the times you do. Try to find other outlets when you are feeling down than quick hook ups which many people find just makes them feel worse.  I suggest some therapy if you can access it, not because of your diagnosis, but because you need to speak to someone about your state of mind, your self-esteem, and a way to climb out of the box you are putting yourself into. The clock doesn't run backwards, so do what you can to make your life better for the present and future. It may take some work to get there, but most important things in life take a bit of energy and perseverance.",

I wore a condom 98% of the time and almost every time I didn't I caught something.  \n\nThe very last time I caught chlamydia was because I stupidly kept penetrating the guy after cumming to finish him off.  I started to go flaccid and my condom came off inside of him.  I had symptoms a few days later.  First round of doxycycline didn't get rid of it so I had to take another. I got reactive arthritis after that which resolved eventually.  However,  I soon experienced chronic diarrhea (presumably from microbiome alterations) and now I have a debilitating case of chronic SIBO.   The worst part is that he finished before me so I did it for nothing.  \n\nSo, yeah, not wearing condoms can have consequences that are not spoken about much in our community.  But I also think I'm a worst case scenario.  🤷",
