[![Research Ethics](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ethics-Public%20Data%20Research-orange.svg)](research/ethics.md)

## :material-microscope: Research Overview

Counterforce-One is a research platform for detecting health misinformation and analyzing community resilience patterns within immigrant communities on Reddit. This research methodology combines natural language processing, social network analysis, and human-validated approaches to understand how health information spreads in multilingual online communities.

### :material-lightbulb: Research Approach

Unlike traditional misinformation detection systems that focus solely on identifying false content, **Counterforce-One takes a community-centered approach that prioritizes resilience and empowerment**. Our methodology uniquely combines multilingual analysis with community network modeling to understand not just what misinformation exists, but how communities naturally develop resistance and correction mechanisms.

!!! success "Community-Centered Innovation"
    By analyzing support patterns, cross-cultural health information sharing, and community-driven fact-checking behaviors, Counterforce-One reveals the **inherent strength** within immigrant communities rather than just their vulnerabilities. This paradigm shift from deficit-based to asset-based research creates actionable insights that communities can use to strengthen their own information ecosystems.
