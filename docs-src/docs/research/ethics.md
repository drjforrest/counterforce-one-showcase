# Ethics and Privacy

## Ethical Framework for Public Data Research

This project follows ethical research principles for publicly available social media data:

### Data Collection Ethics
- **Public Data Only**: All data is collected from publicly posted Reddit content
- **No Private Information**: No collection of private messages, emails, or personal details
- **Platform Compliance**: Full adherence to Reddit Terms of Service and API guidelines
- **Respectful Scraping**: Rate-limited collection that doesn't burden Reddit's servers

### Privacy Protection
- **User Anonymization**: All usernames are hashed or removed from datasets
- **No Personal Tracking**: No attempt to link posts to real-world identities
- **Content Anonymization**: Removal of potentially identifying details from text
- **Secure Storage**: Data stored with appropriate access controls and encryption

### Research Ethics Standards
- **Community Benefit**: Research designed to benefit the communities being studied
- **Transparency**: Open methodology and findings shared with communities
- **Respectful Representation**: Avoiding deficit-based characterizations of communities
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Recognition of cultural contexts in health discussions

### Institutional Review
- **Ethics Review Planned**: IRB/REB submission planned pending funding confirmation
- **Public Data Precedent**: Research follows established practices for public social media analysis
- **Risk Assessment**: Minimal risk given public nature of data and anonymization practices
- **Community Consultation**: Ongoing dialogue with studied communities about research approach

### Data Governance
- **Limited Retention**: Data deleted after research completion unless required for reproducibility
- **Access Controls**: Restricted access to research data among authorized personnel only
- **Sharing Protocols**: Any data sharing follows additional anonymization and approval processes
- **Audit Trail**: Documentation of all data handling and processing steps

This framework ensures responsible research practices while studying important public health communication patterns in online communities.
