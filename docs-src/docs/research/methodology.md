# Research Methodology

Overview of the research methodology and analytical approach.

## Research Data Collection
- Ethical collection of publicly available Reddit content
- Cross-platform community analysis across immigrant communities
- Multilingual data gathering for diverse populations
- Anonymization and privacy protection protocols

## Network Analysis Methodology

Our research methodology includes sophisticated network analysis to understand community resilience patterns:

### Research Network Construction
- Social interaction mapping from comment reply structures
- Analysis of engagement and response patterns
- Community clustering to identify knowledge brokers
- Temporal analysis of information flow dynamics

### Research Network Analysis
Our research generates network visualizations that reveal:
- **Information propagation patterns** - How health information spreads through communities
- **Community response mechanisms** - How communities address and correct misinformation
- **Knowledge broker identification** - Influential users in health discussions
- **Support network structures** - Peer support patterns in health contexts

### Case Study Methodology
Four key research case studies include network analysis:
1. **U=U Information Spread** - Research on how accurate treatment information circulates
2. **Subtle Misinformation Detection** - Study of challenges in identifying partially false information
3. **Peer Support Networks** - Analysis of community response to personal health announcements
4. **Knowledge Gap Analysis** - Research into areas where community education is needed

Each network analysis reveals patterns of node connectivity based on community engagement and information flow structures.

## Research Analysis Framework
- Misinformation detection through community-centered approaches
- Community resilience metric development
- Cross-cultural health communication patterns
- Validation through human expert annotation

## Technical Implementation
The research methodology is implemented using:
- Python-based analysis pipeline
- PostgreSQL database with pgvector for semantic analysis
- NetworkX for graph construction and analysis
- Scientific computing libraries for statistical analysis
